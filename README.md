# Simple Contact Form Project  
## Overview  
This project involves building a Simple Contact Form that captures essential user details such as their name, email, and message. The goal is to create a functional, user-friendly, and accessible form that allows users to submit their information. The project is designed to help me practice HTML form creation and Git branching

## Features
- User-Friendly Form: Includes fields for Name, Email, and Message.
- Form Validation: Ensures that all fields are filled before submission.
- Responsive Design: The form layout adapts well to different screen sizes.
- Accessible: Labels are provided for each input field to enhance screen reader compatibility.

## Project Instructions
- **Form Layout**: Use proper labels above input fields to clearly identify them, with appropriate spacing for easy reading.
- **Form Structure**: Ensure a clean and intuitive structure to guide the user.
- **Submission**: Once the user fills out the form, they can submit the details by clicking the "Send Message" button.

## Git Workflow
### Repository Setup:

- Initialize a Git repository and create a develop branch as your default branch.
Branching:

- Create a feature branch from develop called feature/form.
Push Changes:

- After completing the form, push all changes to the feature/form branch.
Merge:

- When ready, you can merge the feature/form branch into develop.

## How to Run the Project
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Jossy6/Week-2-milestone1.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\WEEK-2-Milestone\Week-2-milestone1
```
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the form

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was ensuring that the form structure was accessible and intuitive for users. Another was setting up the proper branching workflow in Git to maintain a clean code structure.

## Technologies Used
**HTML**: For the form structure.  
**CSS** (optional for styling): For adding any custom design if needed.
