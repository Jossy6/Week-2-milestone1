Project: Build a Simple Contact Form
Objective: Create a user-friendly contact form that captures essential user information.
Instructions:
Form Structure:

Ensure the form has a clear and descriptive title at the top (e.g., "Contact Us").
Field Requirements:
Name Field:
Label: "Your Name"
Input Type: Text
Placeholder: "Enter your name"
Position: This field should be the first input in the form.
Email Field:
Label: "Your Email"
Input Type: Email
Placeholder: "Enter your email address"
Position: This field should follow the name field.
Message Field:
Label: "Your Message"
Input Type: Textarea
Placeholder: "Type your message here"
Position: This field should come after the email field.
Submit Button:
Label: "Send Message"
Input Type: Submit

Styling and Layout:
Ensure the form has consistent spacing between fields.
Use labels to clearly identify each input field, positioned above the respective input.
Maintain a clean and simple layout to enhance usability.
Accessibility Considerations:
Ensure all input fields have associated labels for screen readers.
Use placeholder text to guide users on what to enter but do not rely solely on it.
Submission:
Once completed, review your form for functionality and aesthetics.
Create a repository and push your code
For your git practice, make develop your default then make a feature branch from develop called “feature/form”
Good luck, and be creative! This should be completed by 4pm tomorrow, 22nd of october 2024.
